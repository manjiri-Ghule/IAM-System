Explanation of Components:

Identity Providers: External authentication sources (e.g., Google, Facebook, LDAP, Active Directory).

Clients: Applications that rely on IAM System for authentication, including Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and APIs.

Keycloak Server: Central IAM solution that handles user authentication, token issuance, and authorization.

Admin Console: Used by administrators to configure realms, clients, roles, and policies.

Authentication Protocols: Open standards like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML ensure secure and standardized communication.

Token Issuance: IAM System generates access tokens and refresh tokens for authenticated sessions.

Authorization Engine: Manages resource permissions based on roles and policies.

User Federation: Connects external user directories like LDAP or Active Directory for user authentication.

User Database: Stores user information and credentials locally if not using external directories.
